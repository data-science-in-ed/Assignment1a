In this assignment you will be setting up the software and online tools that you will be using throught this course. Within the [tools repository](https://github.com/data-science-in-ed/Tools) there are links and instructions to relevant sites. If you have any problems, you can tweet them using the hashtag #DSE16, or you can create an [*issue* within this repository](https://github.com/data-science-in-ed/Assignment1a/issues). 

The first stop is to create the accounts we will be using: 

1. Start by creating a personal [Github account](https://github.com/join?source=header) *if you do not already have one*.
2. Then create a [Twitter](www.twitter.com) account *if you do not already have one*.
3. Next you will need to install for the software we will be using if you do not already have them installed (if you do have them make sure they are the latest versions). Links and instructions can be found in the [Tools reporsitory](https://github.com/data-science-in-ed/Tools) for:
   * R

   * Firefox
   * Zotero plugin for Firefox

4. Now you can connect your Github account to your RStudio installation by following these istructions.
